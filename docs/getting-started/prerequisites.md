# Prerequisites

## Preparing your local environment

Our project is written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and is based on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
For development purposes you can either run our project fully native on your machine or run it in docker using our `docker-compose` file.
For either path please ensure the following things are installed on your local system:

- Node.js: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) greater than version 22.11 (includes npm)
- Docker: [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- Docker Compose: [Install Docker Compose plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- Some sort of CodeEditor or IDE. We have had good experience with [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as well as [Intelij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
